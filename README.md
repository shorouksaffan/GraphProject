# Graph Algorithms Project

## Overview
This project is a **C++ implementation of fundamental graph algorithms**.  
It reads a graph from a file, stores it using an efficient data structure, and applies algorithms such as **Dijkstra’s shortest path** and **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**.

## Features
* Graph representation using adjacency lists
* File input and output handling
* Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm
* Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm
* Modular and well-organized code structure
